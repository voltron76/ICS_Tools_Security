## Honeypots

- [SCADA Honeynet (Digital Bond)](http://www.digitalbond.com/tools/scada-honeynet/) - The SCADA Honeynet appears to be a PLC. It is highly realistic with support for the management interfaces, a points list taken from an actual installation, and default parameters unchanged.
- [SCADA honeynet (Cisco)](http://scadahoneynet.sourceforge.net/) - Building Honeypots for Industrial Network.
- [Conpot](https://github.com/mushorg/conpot) - Conpot is an ICS honeypot with the goal to collect intelligence about the motives and methods of adversaries targeting industrial control systems.
- [Gridpot](https://github.com/sk4ld/gridpot) - Open source tools for realistic-behaving electric grid honeynets.
- [GasPot](https://github.com/sjhilt/GasPot) - A honeypot that has been designed to simulate a Veeder Root Gaurdian AST. These Tank Gauges are common in the oil and gas industry for Gas Station tanks to help with Inventory of fuels. GasPot was designed to randomize as much as possible so no two instances look exactly the same.
- [T-Pot](https://github.com/dtag-dev-sec/tpotce) - T-Pot - The All In One Honeypot Platform
- [SEL-2924 Bluetooth to Serial adapter Emulator](https://github.com/digitalbond/CTF-Challenges/tree/master/S4x2016/SEL-Emulator) - This project simulates an SEL-2924 Bluetooth to Serial adapter, as it would appear if it was accidentally left connected to a SEL-751A Feeder protection relay. DO NOT USE THIS AS A PRODUCTION HONEYPOT: there are security vulnerabilities both known and unknown in the implementation.
- [HoneyPoint Security Serverâ„¢](http://microsolved.com/HoneyPoint-server.html) - Commercial distributed honeypot, includes IT and SCADA emulators.
- [Awesome Honeypots](https://github.com/paralax/awesome-honeypots) - A list of awesome honeypots, tools, components and much more.
- [Nozomi TriStation Basic Honeypot](https://github.com/NozomiNetworks/tricotools) - another TriStation dissector, this time from Nozomi, also incldues pcap, and basic honeypot simulator.
- [Spotify (smart grid honeypot)](https://www.illinois.adsc.com.sg/spotify/index.html) - Smart Grid Honeypot for National Cybersecurity R&D Lab (NCL) Testbed
