# ICS Tools - Auditing and Signatures

Developed as a community asset

## Advisories
- [ICS-Advisory-Project](https://github.com/icsadvprj/ICS-Advisory-Project) - The ICS Advisory Project is an open-source project to provide DHS CISA ICS-CERT Advisories data in Comma Separated Value (CSV) format to support vulnerability analysis for the OT/ICS community. 
## Organizational Assessment Tools

- [DHS CSET](https://github.com/cisagov/cset) - The Cyber Security Evaluation Tool (CSET®) is a Department of Homeland Security (DHS) product that assists organizations in protecting their key national cyber assets. It was developed under the direction of the DHS National Cyber Security Division (NCSD) by cybersecurity experts and with assistance from the National Institute of Standards and Technology. This tool provides users with a systematic and repeatable approach for assessing the security posture of their cyber systems and networks. It includes both high-level and detailed questions related to all industrial control and IT systems.

It provides organisations with questions they can use to assess the current state of their own cyber security and recommends the safeguards they should implement next (and in which areas). All safeguards are assigned to corresponding parts of the standards and procedures of IT-Grundschutz, ISO 27001, IEC62443, and the BSI ICS Security Compendium, which facilitates the transition to using a holistic management system for information security.

## Auditing / Scanning

- [Bandolier Security Audit Files](http://www.digitalbond.com/tools/bandolier/) - These audit files are used with the Nessus scanner’s compliance plugins to audit the security settings of control system components. A typical control system will have over 1,000 security settings including the OS settings, database and webserver settings, and the SCADA or DCS application settings. Digital Bond worked with the vendors, such as ABB, AREVA, Emerson, OSIsoft, Telvent, …, to identify the optimal security settings for their systems. Bandolier Security Audit Files are very useful at FAT to insure the system is installed in an optimal security configuration and periodically to verify the configuration has not degraded.
